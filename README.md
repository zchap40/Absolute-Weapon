# Absolute-Weapon

"The Absolute Weapon" by Bernard Brodie (ed.), 1946.

A key early text on nuclear policy newly typeset in LaTeX by A. S. Sadek. Bernard Brodie was the architect of US nuclear strategic policy, and his writings were carefully studied by the other nuclear powers, including China and the USSR. His work has been a major factor in the prevention of the use of nuclear weapons the past 77 years.

This text is difficult to obtain, and thus a newly typeset and formatted edition is provided here, based on the declassified copy from President Dwight D. Eisenhower's archives.

In view of the unusual geostrategic environment as of 2022, and the dramatically increased risk in the use of nuclear weapons, it is hoped the wider availability of this text will go some way to helping policy makers formulate effective strategy.
